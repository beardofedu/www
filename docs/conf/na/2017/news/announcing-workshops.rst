Announcing Workshops
====================

As a part of our `presentations and speakers announcement </conf/na/2017/news/announcing-presentations/>`_ we included information about two workshops.

However, we feel that since the workshops are a new type of activity, they deserve their own announcement!

This year we are excited to offer the following workshops:

* `Learn how to Git </conf/na/2017/speakers/#speaker-matthew-desmond>`_ by Matthew Desmond
* `Structuring and writing documentation </conf/na/2017/speakers/#speaker-heidi-waterhouse>`_ by Heidi Waterhouse

These workshops will be ticketed separately and are extremely limited in capacity (30 people per workshop). You can buy workshop tickets at our normal ticket site: https://ti.to/writethedocs/write-the-docs-na-2017

For detailed information about the goals and structure of the workshops, check out the new `Workshops page </conf/na/2017/workshops>`_ on our website.
