About the conference
====================

We invite you to join 400 other folks for a three-day event to explore the art
and science of documentation. The Write the Docs Portland conference covers any
topic related to documentation in the software industry. Past talks have also
covered such diverse topics as empathy, the history of math symbols, and using
emoji to keep your users' attention.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the same room:
Writers, Developers, Developer Relations, and Support Staff. We all have things
to learn, and there's no better way than coming together in the same room and
getting to know each other.

The main presentation track takes place from **May 15-16 (Monday and Tuesday)
from 9am to 6pm**. We will return to the historic `Crystal Ballroom
<http://www.mcmenamins.com/CrystalBallroom>`_,  `centrally located
<http://goo.gl/maps/D2WrJ>`_ in the heart of Portland. During the main event we
also run a :doc:`/conf/na/2017/unconference`, downstairs in Lola's Room.

You can find out more information about the venue and its accessibility on our
:doc:`/conf/na/2017/venue` page.
