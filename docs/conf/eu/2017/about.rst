About the conference
====================

We invite you to join 300 folks for a three-day event to explore the art and science of
documentation.
The Write the Docs Prague conference covers any topic related to documentation in the software industry.
Past talks have also covered such diverse topics as empathy,
the history of math symbols,
and using emoji to keep your users' attention.

Write the Docs brings *everyone* who writes the docs together in the
same room:
Writers,
Developers,
Developer Relations,
and Support Staff.
We all have things to learn,
and there's no better way than coming together in the same room and getting to know each other.

The main presentation track takes place on **September 11-12 (Monday and Tuesday) from 9am to 6pm**. 
We will return to the `Auto Klub <http://www.ganimed.cz/>`_, located `across the main train station <https://goo.gl/maps/2pdRtnmrJrv>`_ in the historical city center.

Inspired by the Crystal Ballroom in Portland, the main presentations will be held in (you guessed it) a ballroom, and the :doc:`/conf/eu/2017/unconference` sessions as well as the writing day will be held in adjoining rooms.

You can find out more information about the venue and its accessibility on our :doc:`/conf/eu/2017/venue` page.
