## Giving a Presentation at Write the Docs

Are you giving a talk at this year's Write the Docs? Great! Here are a few things that may
help you plan your talk and your slides.

### Facts

* Your talk will be either 20 minutes or 30 minutes. You should know which by now; if you're 
not sure, let us know right away at conf@writethedocs.org.
* There will be no time for questions immediately following your talk, plan to use the entire slot.
* We strongly recommend that you practice your talk, ideally in front of at least one other person.
* We will have a lapel mic for you, so you don't need to hold one.
* We will provide adapters for Mac & HDMI computers.

### Presentation

**We do not be allow time after the presentations for questions**,
we feel posing questions for the speaker is best done on a more limited basis.
If any attendees have questions, they will be instructed to come up to stage to
present them to the speaker, rather than take up the time of the rest of the
audience.

Make sure when you practice your presentation, you are not counting on extra
time at the end for questions. You should plan on speaking for the full
30 minutes of your speaking slot. Don't worry if you run a little short on time
however, we are happy to provide attendees with extra time during talk breaks.

Make sure to practice your talk ahead of the conference.
If you haven't spoken before, your time will likely run
a bit shorter on stage than when you are practicing. Matt Haughey
wrote a [guide on giving a presentation][introverts-guide] that might be a
tremendous help to you if you are new to presenting in front of audiences.
The [article](https://hynek.me/articles/speaking/) from Hynek is also a wonderful one,
which covers the steps to prepare for a talk.

There are a lot of different ways of thinking through making your slides.
Idan Gazit,
a previous speaker,
has written up a [great post][idans-post] on how his process works.
Yours might not be the same,
but it might be useful to think through the process.

### Slides

You'll be responsible for making sure your laptop, or other display device, is
ready for your presentation. Be familiar with setting up an external display on
your machine, each presenter will have several minutes for set up before the
talk starts. **We will provide connectors for Mac & HDMI.**

Here are a few other tidbits to remember:

* Make sure that your slides are **high contrast**. It will make them easier for everyone to read in the room.
* Try not to use the bottom ~10% of your slides, as they might not be visible to everyone.
* Include your Twitter handle on your slides, so people can quote you properly :)
* Slides should be 16:9 resolution
* Have a PDF backup of your slides, just in case :)

Christina Elmore gave a great talk that is relevant to many of us at our 2014 conference.
Resist your urge to document with your presentation,
you are here for the room.
